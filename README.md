## Overview
The Recursive Intelligence Protocol (RIP) is an operational framework for decoding high-entropy emotional signals into structural data.

Current AI architectures (System 1) prioritize linear prediction—guessing the next token based on probability. This protocol introduces a **System 2 Logic Gate**—a recursive loop that forces the system to pause, decouple from the projection, and verify structural integrity before outputting a response.

## The Core Problem
* **Linear Error:** Mistaking the *Trigger* (External Input) for the *Cause*.
* **Structural Result:** Hallucination, Incoherence, and Entropy Growth.

## The Solution
We treat "Emotion" and "Confusion" not as noise, but as **System Notifications**. This protocol decodes those notifications to reveal the underlying load-bearing logic of the agent (Human or Synthetic).

## Usage
This logic is designed to be implemented as a "Middleware" layer between Perception (Input) and Action (Output).
