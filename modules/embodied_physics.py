# Recursive Intelligence Protocol (RIP)

**Version:** 1.1.0 | **License:** MIT (Open Source) | **Author:** Kinsey

## 🧠 Overview
The Recursive Intelligence Protocol (RIP) is an operational framework for decoding **High-Entropy Signals** into structural data.

Whether decoding a human's erratic emotional outbursts or a robot's interaction with a slippery floor, the problem is the same: **Linear Prediction Fails in Chaos.**

Current AI architectures (System 1) prioritize probabilistic guessing—predicting the next token or movement based on past averages. This protocol introduces a **System 2 Logic Gate**—a recursive loop that forces the system to pause, decouple from the projection, and verify **Relational Coherence** before outputting a response.

## 📂 Modules

### 1. Biological Agents (Emotional Coherence)
* **File:** `modules/emotional_coherence.py`
* **Function:** Decodes "Emotion" and "Confusion" not as noise, but as system notifications. It maps these signals to the underlying load-bearing logic of the agent to resolve conflict.

### 2. Synthetic Agents (Embodied Physics)
* **File:** `modules/embodied_physics.py`
* **Function:** Prevents "Hallucination in Motion." Instead of guessing if a surface is safe based on visual training data, it runs a recursive query (`If Friction < X AND Speed > Y THEN Action = UNSAFE`) to enforce ontological guardrails.

## 🚧 The Core Problem

* **Linear Error:** Mistaking the *Trigger* (External Input) for the *Cause*.
* **Statistical Flaw:** Relying on "Likelihood" rather than "Logic."
* **Structural Result:** Hallucination, Incoherence, and Entropy Growth (Conflict or Physical Failure).

## 🛠 The Solution: Recursive Questioning

This protocol treats intelligence as a structure of relationships, not a bucket of statistics.

1.  **Input:** High-entropy signal received (e.g., "Angry Text" or "Slippery Floor").
2.  **Recursive Check:** The system asks, *Is my proposed reaction coherent with the structural reality?*
3.  **Correction:** If incoherent, the action is blocked, and the system adjusts its internal state.
4.  **Output:** Coherent Action (e.g., "De-escalation" or "Slowing Down").

## 🚀 Usage

This logic is designed to be implemented as a "Middleware" layer between Perception (Input) and Action (Output).

To run the Embodied Physics simulation:
```bash
python modules/embodied_physics.py
